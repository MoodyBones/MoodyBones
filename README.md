A Frontend Developer, Design Systems and CX Professional. After 11 years in Europe, I'm excited to reestablish my career on home soil. I'm a self-taught coder, working as a frontend developer since 2020. I love developing beautiful products that are sustainable, universal and easy for non-technical people to interpret.
