- Check out the projects I built [here](https://losfuerlesbos.com/) and [here](https://stiftung-seenotrettung.org/de/).
- I love learning by building projects, do you have a project I could help with?

### 🌱&nbsp;&nbsp; STACK
- I enjoy working with: Vue.js, Nuxt, Gridsome, GraphQL, TailwindCSS, SCSS, Netlify, Headless CMS, i18n, a11y & I'm a big fan of Web Animation (CSS & GSAP).
